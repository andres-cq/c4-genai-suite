# The Users Page

The Users Page allows the creation, editing and deletion of users, as well as searching by name. To edit an existing user entry, simply click it.
When creating a user or checking the list of existing users, one should understand the following attributes of a user: 

| Attribute  | Description
|------------|------------
| Name       | The display name of the user, and the searchable attribute.
| Email      | an email address that allows contacting the user.
| User Group | set to "Admin" for administrators, or set other user [groups](/admin/user-groups)
| API Key    | Optional. Generate it for users that need to use the API. This key will only work, while the user is in the "Admin" group.
| Password   | The users password, which remains hidden and can be reset later here.
